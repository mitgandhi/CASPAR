# Constrain to be discussed #

$ The modules which where prepared in past were made with vs code 2010 professtional IDE, So thirdparty libraries which are used in this software are too old. In addition few have no updates and this denotes that it cannot be programmed on other new surfaces and so we have to stick to old version of Visual studio 2010 Professional .
